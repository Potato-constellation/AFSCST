Today I woke up like any other looking around my apartment at yellow peeling paint and the drywall that lay behind it. It was a perfectly normal day except it wasn't. I couldn't put my finger on why yet, it was perfectly normal but… it wasn’t somehow I pondered for hours on why the only difference was that feeling I pondered for so long that I would have been late to my job if it wasn’t the weekend. Then it hit me, it hit me harder than a freight train hitting a stuck car. I heard the word job and realized I have no memories before this day. Before this day was like an abyss which swallowed everything. It was as if I just started existing just because some being wished I had knowledge with no apparent source. It was as if the knowledge was with me the moment I started existing.
<br>
<br>
But thinking about this won’t provide me with anything useful. What is useful for me is thinking about something else. I have no goal and therefore no meaning to life. Not even an arbitrary goal, not anything. The only thing I have is my ability to think and reason, so on a whim I just decided my goal was to become a better person in every way. To start making this goal a reality in my apartment I started exercising just simple push-ups, sit-ups and squats. I then went to my bathroom to brush my teeth. I looked in the mirror noting my appearance as if it was my first time seeing myself. I was an average white 23 year old with short auburn hair and slightly noticeable stubble as well as dark brown eyes. I wasn't overweight but not underweight. I was wearing slightly baggy jeans with a white t-shirt and a baggy green jacket.

As I start brushing my teeth I realize I have to shave. When I finish brushing my teeth I grab my razor… but I never had a razor, or did I don’t know maybe this has something to do with that endless dark abyss in my memory from earlier. As I finish shaving I walk outside the darkness is almost blinding. As I look around I see the neon signs which make up most of the light and the tight alleyways and small streets and stores. The sun and sky being blocked out by a thick mat of smoke and pollution reducing the sunlight to nothing making the difference between night and day moot.
<br>
<br>
I decide to go for a run to get some cardio, as I run I look at the trolleys moving along the tracks implanted in the roads as some sort of metallic root system. I decided to ponder a couple things. As I jog down the streets of Babylon listening to moonlight sonata I ponder why a being would create a world as cruel and horrible as this one when they could create a perfect one where everyone is happy perhaps it’s for some twisted sense of amusement or maybe it’s because it wants to see me succeed. While I was lost in thought I accidentally ran into somebody, her green eyes almost piercing through my soul when suddenly she collapsed. I pull out my phone, call 911 and try to do chest compressions… but where did my phone come from? I didn't have one before, but I did. It's as if the memories themselves were forcing themselves into my brain. As I perform chest compressions and wait for 911 to get here I try and clear my mind of those strange thoughts from earlier. After 911 got there and I jogged home layed in my bed and slowly drifted into unconsciousness I noticed these dark particles almost the opposite of even the idea of light yet also mimicking it.
<br>
<br>
When I woke up the beads of darkness had disappeared leaving the light of the signs outside to replace them. Soon after I started my routine I got a call from the hospital. The woman I had tried to save had died of a heart attack, almost trying to remind me of my own mortality. After I’m done working out I go and brush my teeth and take a shower. While in the shower I ponder about mortality and death. Is it simply a darkness which takes over everyone eventually, is it a gateway to a new realm or is it just someone being taken out of the story. After I got out of the shower, dried off and got dressed I jogged to work. It was a simple office 9 to 5, boring but it pays the bills. I walk in and am greeted by my coworkers as well as my friends Justin and Shane. They are quite the characters, Justin is a laid back kinda guy who likes to focus on the small things, Meanwhile Shane is a social guy, He's kinda popular around the office but he knows when to shut up. While I’m talking with Justin and Shane my boss Elizabeth walks towards us and starts preaching about efficiency and how work is a time to work and not a time to socialize. Nobody likes her, she nags about the dumbest things when she pays us pennies on the dollar. Sadly in this dystopian society there aren't many other options other than to just starve if I quit the job.

 <b>Chapter 1</b>: A Rift in Reality
<br>
<br>
Today, I awoke much like any other day, surveying my apartment’s yellow peeling paint and the drywall that lay behind it. Despite the appearance of a perfectly normal day, an unsettling feeling lingered. Today wasn’t normal, though I couldn’t pinpoint why. I couldn't put my finger on why yet, it was perfectly normal but… it wasn’t. Hours passed as I pondered on the subtle yet significant difference. Why was the only difference that feeling? I pondered for so long that I would have been late to my job if it wasn’t the weekend. Then it hit me.  It hit me harder than a freight train striking a car on the tracks.. I heard the word job, and realized it was the absence of memories before this day that made it so abnormal. Before this day was like an abyss which swallowed everything. It was as if I had just sprung into existence, just because some unknown being bestowed upon me knowledge, with no apparent source. It was as if the knowledge was with me the moment I started existing.
<br><br>
However, dwelling on this enigma won’t provide me with anything useful. What is useful for me is thinking about something important. I lacked any goals, not even an arbitrary one..Not anything. Therefore, I have no meaning to life. I was armed only with the ability to think and reason. I whimsically decided my goal was self-improvement, to become a better person in every way. To start making this goal a reality, I began a simple exercise in my apartment, incorporating push-ups, sit-ups, and squats. Then, I went to my bathroom to brush my teeth. While gazing into the bathroom mirror, I observed my average appearance—23 years old, short auburn hair, slightly noticeable stubble, and dark brown eyes. I wasn't overweight or underweight. I was clad in slightly baggy jeans, a white t-shirt, and a loose green jacket.
<br><br>
 As I started brushing my teeth I realized the need for a shave. When I finished brushing my teeth, I grabbed my razor. Wait. I never had a razor. Maybe I did, but I don’t know. It seemed my memories were forcing themselves into existence, a phenomenon that was like the dark abyss in my recollection earlier. Completing the shave, I stepped outside into the blinding darkness. I looked around to see the neon signs piercing through the artificial gloom, casting the only light on narrow alleys and small streets. The sun and sky’s attempts to penetrate the thick mat of smog rendered the boundary between day and night moot.
<br><br>
I decide to go for a run, to get in some cardio, as I run I look at the trolleys gliding along metallic tracks embedded in the roads, resembling a metallic root system. Lost in thought as I jogged down the streets of Babylon, listening to moonlight sonata,I contemplated the cruelty of the world. Why would a being create a world as cruel and horrible as this one? Why didn’t they create a perfect one where everyone is happy? Perhaps it exists for some sadistic amusement or maybe it’s because it wants to see my personal triumphs. While pondering, lost in the world of my mind, a collision with a woman interrupted my reverie. Her green eyes bore into my soul. Then she suddenly collapsed. Reacting swiftly, I pulled out my phone, called 911, and began performing chest compressions. 
<br><br>
Wait, where did this phone come from? It seemed to just materialize. I never had a phone before, but now I do. It's as if the memories themselves were forcing themselves into my brain. As I awaited help and performed chest compressions, I tried to purge my mind of the strange thoughts that have been haunting me. With the arrival of emergency services, I jogged home, increasingly aware of the artificiality of the world. Returning home, I fell onto my bed, succumbed to exhaustion, and drifted into unconsciousness. As my consciousness slowly ripped itself away, I noticed these dark particles that were the antithesis of light, but somehow it seemed to mimic it.

<b>Chapter 2</b>: Ink of Resilience
<br><br>
 Upon waking, the ominous beads of darkness had vanished, replaced by the harsh light of neon signs. Continuing my routine, I got a call from the hospital. It delivered somber news—the woman I tried to save succumbed to a heart attack, a stark reminder of my own mortality. I worked out, brushed my teeth, and took a shower. All with the news on my mind. It was in the shower I contemplated the most about mortality and death. Is it simply a darkness which takes over everyone eventually? Is it a gateway to a new realm? Maybe it is just someone being taken out of the story. Post-shower, I dried off, dressed, and jogged to work—a mundane 9-to-5 office job, boring but necessary to pay the bills.
<br><br>
  At the workplace, my friends Justin and Shane, with their distinct personalities, offer me a warm welcome.They are quite the characters. Justin is a laid back guy who likes to focus on the small things. Meanwhile, Shane is a social guy. He's popular around the office, but he knows when to be quiet. Amidst a conversation with Shane, our boss Sharon approached, preaching about how efficiency should be prioritized over socializing. Nobody likes her. She was unpopular in the office and notorious for meager wages. She constantly nags about the dumbest things. Sadly, in this dystopian reality, quitting the job seemed impractical, as alternatives were scarce.
<br><br>
 During the lunch break, I jogged home, accompanied by music. I made it home, and walked over to the kitchen. Despite an exhaustive search, my fridge yielded nothing edible. Thankfully, my paycheck just came in. 263 dollars. That was what I thought to myself, but sadly this was actually a slightly above average wage. Though that was because a lot of people were unemployed and lived in “The Barrens“. I jogged to the convenience store to buy myself some instant ramen. Back home, as I prepared my meal, the mundanity of my story struck me. Returning to work, Justin and Shane, in surprisingly average appearances, greeted me with jokes before discussing our shared fate as friends and coworkers. 
<br><br>
  Justin was an extremely average dude with hazel eyes, medium length black hair and slightly tanned skin which is rare to see nowadays due to the absence of the sun. Whereas Shane is a pale guy with freckles and copper colored hair, strangely his eyes were a deep blue, almost like “the ocean from before“. After work, tiredness set in, ink-like blobs appeared, though not as many. Intriguingly, as I reached out to touch one of these blobs, it melded with me akin to a symbiote. Although I felt its presence within me, its purpose remained elusive. I didn't know what to do with it. When I tried moving it, it responded. My attempts at manipulation yielded surprising results; after concentrating for about a minute, I successfully molded the ink into a simple form—a bowl—in my hand. Subsequently, the ink's presence dissipated within me. Further usage was warranted, as it became evident that these ink only materialized when fatigue overcame me. 
<br><br>
   Determined to maximize my understanding of the mysterious ink phenomenon, I decided to stay awake for an extended time and accumulate the ink. Upon overcoming the initial surge of adrenaline sparked by the appearance of the ink, I gradually succumbed to the fatigue. As weariness set in, the ink materialized as it did before, prompting me to actively collect it until the point of exhaustion ushered me into slumber. Upon awakening, a palpable sense of the ink within my body greeted me. Its volume seemed substantial, enough to form a cube with a volume of 8 feet. Deviating from my previous use, I decided to channel the ink's potential into fortifying my own physical capabilities. To my astonishment, it worked. The ink, it appeared, possessed the capacity not only to enhance my attributes but also to give lasting strength, albeit at a notably inefficient rate when compared to its transformative abilities. This became apparent after the series of tests, when the ink was entirely depleted.
<br><br>
  Following an extensive period of experimentation, I went on to the workplace with a different objective in mind—venturing into The Barrens to control the formidable terrorbeasts. But that is for later. As I jogged towards work, a profound realization of my personal growth hit me. Midway through my jog, an alarming sight disrupted my thinking: smoke billowing out from my workplace. Hastening my pace, I arrived at the scene only to be met with the office building reduced to rubble. A man, clad in a bright white hoodie, stood amidst the wreckage, his gaze locking onto mine as I approached. Instinctively, I hid myself from his view. The man in white declared, “and with that, the black is dead.“ A shiver ran down my spine as I thought, “Was he attempting to kill me?“ Soon, the man departed, leaving me to survey the devastation. As I sifted through the debris, I uncovered the bodies of Shane and Justin, the life that once animated their eyes now fading. In their final moments, they uttered words of solace, “don’t blame yourself.“ Determination surged within me as I slowly dropped their cold bodies to the ground. “Well, it seems I have a new objective—to avenge my friends,“ I muttered to myself. This new quest now supplanted my prior one.

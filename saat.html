 It was a lovely day till it happened. The world suddenly convulsed violently, as if it was experiencing a seizure, yet I was the soul witness out of all the people I knew. Subsequently, eerie chill pervaded the atmosphere, and everything began to change into awful, grotesque forms. Cars appeared to liquefy into sentient pools of goo, while trees whispered endless and ominous promises of riches before consuming someone, and promptly decaying. It was a terrifying scene, but no one else I knew saw it. Instead, they dismissed my account as insanity, labeling me as crazy and delusional. That was three days before the unthinkable happened… the world vanished without a trace.. Earth ceased to exist; no streets, no homes, nothing remained. 
<br><br>
 You probably wouldn’t understand if you aren’t from earth, but I guess I am writing this to offer an explanation from my perspective. The events of that day amounted to nothing short of what could be described as hell on Earth. Initially, everything seemed ordinary, much like any other day, until the ground began to tremble, mirroring the events of three days prior, and everything else I said happened in the exact order as I said it would. Panic ensued as everyone scrambled to seek refuge, resorting to pushing others into the spaces where cars once stood, just to get devoured by the trees. No one knew why it happened, but the ones that survived all of this chaos were in for a ride. I never mentioned who I am, and since this is my story of what happened I guess it would be right for me to introduce myself. My name is Leon; I’m a human from earth, and, I suppose, you could say I was one of the special ones. Following the cataclysm, all inhabitants of Earth found themselves scattered across what we now refer to as the new world. Fortunately, my destination proved more favorable than most, as I found myself in the woods of Elven Territory, and luckily they didn’t notice me or the few others that were with me.

<br><br>
    My name is Leon. I’m what most would consider a normal high school teen, or so most think. Since I was about seven years old, I’ve been studying something most others don't believe is real, something that only exists in the movies: paranormal anomalies. These anomalies encompass phenomena like ghosts, wendigos, and more. Since explaining the intricacies of this would be complex, I'll spare you the details and cut to the important part. From a young age, I've possessed this innate ability to experience visions akin to déjà vu, but the things I saw were always other worldly. I saw otherworldly landscapes: verdant overgrown forests teeming with lush foliage, or peculiar camps nestled within the branches of trees, resembling groups of tree houses. At times, my visions depict realms inhabited by creatures beyond imagination, such as gargantuan wolves with acidic saliva or serpents whose very touch incinerates all in its path. That’s not even mentioning the scariest of it all, and that’s what concerns me the most if it is visions of dèja vu. The worse encounters involve encounters with shadowy entities bearing humanoid forms. Whenever one of these entities manifests, it feels akin to staring death itself in the face. Other times, I've encountered anomalous beings radiating such intense light that it feels as though their brilliance could sear through my closed eyelids.
<br><br>
    When I first started having these visions I was scared out of my mind, and thought they were nightmares. However, as time passed, my fear evolved from mere fright to a profound concern: what if these visions are glimpses of reality? It was horrifying sure, but I managed to endure the hell it created for me. Today was the worst one yet, and I fear we may be in for even more trouble in the near future. Upon awakening from a good night’s rest, I rubbed my eyes and promptly prepared for the day, finding everything peaceful with no signs of another unsettling vision. However, as soon as I stepped out the front door, the situation took a drastic turn. After walking out and locking the door behind me as usual, I was startled by the cacophony of incoherent screams emanating from behind. I quickly turned around, and I was confronted with a scene of chaos. Vehicles on the road were beginning to liquefy. Some contained occupants who met a fiery fate, incinerating those nearby before transforming into molten masses. Panic ensued as people scattered in all directions, seeking refuge from the unfolding disaster. Some sought shelter among the trees, while others ran into their homes in a desperate attempt to escape the mayhem. 
<br><br>
   Those who sought refuge near the trees suddenly vanished into thin air, leaving behind an eerie emptiness. Simultaneously, the trees in their vicinity began to contort and tear apart as if some unseen force had triggered a vortex within them. All that could be heard was a haunting chant, promising a boundless abundance of wealth, as it echoed through the air. Everything in its path was consumed, engulfing all nearby with its hypnotic allure, before ultimately decaying and sinking into the earth after consuming those who came to it. Amidst the relentless cycle of this never-ending nightmare, I found myself abruptly awakened, seated at my desk within the confines of our school. Heather, my only friend in this small town, sauntered into the class, late as usual. Taking her place in the desk to my left, she asked if I had succumbed to those haunting dreams once more. With a playful retort, I asked her about her indulgence in half a six-pack the previous night, to which she countered with a jesting, “Yeah, what about it, mom?” Laughter escaped me before I addressed her query, recounting the horrors of my latest nightmarish episode. “Yeah I did have another one, but this one was the worst so far.” I said. She asked what I meant by that, and I gave her a run through of what I saw. She hesitated, then burst into uncontrollable giggles, and I soon joined in, only to be abruptly silenced by the teacher’s stern reprimand. 
<br><br>
   Following that, we went through the rest of the day with jokes and laughter, gossiping about the drama surrounding other people's relationships. As the final bell rang, signaling our release from school, Heather and I slipped out the back of the school. Not too far from the school, there flowed a modest river, not particularly wide but deep enough to conceal something the size of a soda can and a half. As we strolled past some gentle shrubbery, we reached the riverbank where a group of deer peacefully grazed. Heather approached one of the deer that were sipping from the water's edge, gently stroking its fur as it gazed up at her. The doe affectionately licked her face before returning to its drink, prompting Heather to motion for me to join her. Seating myself beside the deer, I began to stroke its ear while Heather retrieved two beers from a small divite in the riverbed. Glancing over at me, she extended one of the bottles, suggesting we unwind and enjoy the afternoon. I hesitated briefly, considering it was a school night, but ultimately decided, "Why not?" and accepted the drink, declaring, "Let's do it."   In synchronization, we cracked open the bottles, and Heather sighed contentedly, remarking that the sound of opening a cold one never loses its charm. I chuckled softly in agreement, prompting her to grin and exclaim, "Hell yeah!" As we sipped our drinks, Heather posed an unexpected question, asking what I would do if the visions turned out to be déjà vu. Caught off guard, I found myself momentarily speechless before gathering my thoughts to respond. I expressed my uncertainty about how I would handle the situation if it were real, but assured her that I wouldn't take long to come up with something. both chuckled, undoubtedly influenced by the alcohol. She finished her can, she crushed it in her hand and tucked it into her bag. Following suit, I handed her my empty can before disposing of it, suggesting that it was time to head home for the day. I stagger as I get up from my spot while she lends me a hand, clearly less affected by the alcohol. We began to walk away from the school hoping we didn’t make too much noise and get caught, and I fell because one of my shoes got caught on a fallen tree branch. I got up and brushed myself off as I attempted to catch up to Heather, before noticing the a teacher starting to chase us, attempting to catch us and give punishment for drinking and staying on campus after hours. 
<br><br>
    I ran struggling to keep my balance, and I told Heather that one of the teachers was chasing us down. We both quickly ran away to escape possible punishment before we lost sight of them, and the school. We slowed down one we reached the forked road where me and her usually split to go to our separate houses, but in my buzzed state of mind I decided to follow her back to her place. As we walked down the road

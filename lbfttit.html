<p>
      It would be his fifth year attending the academy this year. This young man is a generally grade A student who never missed a day of school, even if he was sick. He was well known for working with the younger groups of students, and for always getting in fights with the other older students. His parents were often absent from the house, both usually out drinking all night long, and sleeping till noon before going to their jobs. This boy would be Alex, a boy who has multiple siblings, and a dearly beloved cousin who attends the same school.
<br><br>
     It would be on this one fateful day, July fifth, that there would be a multiplying number of students that stopped coming to school. He woke up groggy, and tired as usual sore from a fight the previous day with some of the older students. He would go to the bathroom to wash his face when he realized a cut. He said to himself ouch as he patted the wound with a paper towel soaked with alcohol from his parents the previous night to disinfect it before putting on a Band-aid. After he does so he would look at the calendar in the kitchen where his siblings would be waiting for his arrival, and all at once ask him to make them some breakfast.
<br><br>
      He would then respond to them “sure, just a minute let me check what we have!” In a friendly positive manner, hiding his pain. He’d open the fridge, and look at all ten siblings saying “we’re going to have pancakes today, how’s that sound.”. They all  responded “yay~!” Shouting with excitement. He would then grab some pancake mix, and make pancakes for everyone before making sure they're all ready to leave for school. After that he sent them off to the bus that had just arrived, and went back inside to get dressed for school himself. 
<br><br>
     He had put on a black shirt with some well worn jeans, and grabbed his ragged backpack before leaving the house. He used his house keys to lock the door behind him as a familiar female voice called cheerfully from the house next door “good morning Alex, you ready to head to school!?” He looked toward where he heard the voice, and responded in a happy tone “good morning to you too Jenny, yeah let’s go!” After that he would walk down the steps to meet her before both proceeded to walk together to school. This would be his cousin, she was an amazing artist, and loved music the most. 
<br><br>
     She would start a conversation with Alex as they walked to school together asking him about the scar on his face. He would reply positively saying “don't worry about it, it's nothing!” She’d then say “well then how’s it going with your parents, are they still out drinking all night?” He in a snarky manner replies “yup, and I don’t think that’s going to really change.” She laughed at his reply before responding cheerfully “well that’s expected!” 
<br><br>
     They then both walked the rest of the way to school in silence, occasionally pointing out a few things that seemed interesting along the way. They eventually arrived at the school, and said goodbye to each other before heading off to their separate classes. He sat through three of his classes before lunch came around, and he rushed into the hallway heading straight to her class. When he got there she wasn’t there, so he went to the lunch room since she usually goes straight there if she doesnt wait to go with him. When he got there he didn’t see her anywhere, and he got concerned, now rushing to the nurses office to see if she’s there.
<br><br>
     When he arrives the nurse looks at him in shock as he’s out of breath from running so much, and asks “what’s it this time, someone else knocked some sense into you?” Alex laughed it off before saying “no, this time I’m here to see if Jenny’s here.” The nurse with no hesitation says “nope, only one’s here is me, and you Alex.” He immediately became more concerned, and ran through the school looking everywhere for Jenny. He became confused, and didn’t know where else to look before he heard some of the older kids he got into fights with talking about someone.
<br><br>
      He listened in on the conversation, hiding, and hoping he wouldn’t get caught. The older kids said while chuckling, “man that was one pretty girl, too bad she didn’t know how to keep her mouth shut!”. Then another one said, “yeah but wasn’t she related to dork face?”. They started chuckling as they passed him going to the lunchroom, and it made him furious. He knew they were talking about him, and even worse they did something to Jenny.
<br><br>
      He ran out of the school looking for her hoping he was wrong, and that they meant someone else. He looked for hours finding nothing, and the bell rang as school ended. After that he decided to go home, and check her house to see if she’s there. On his way he had to wait as a train passed through, and he noticed something off about the rails under it. Once it finally passed he ran over to the rails, and fell down to the ground tears welling up in his eyes. 
<br><br>
       He screamed in agony as he looked down at what was left of Jenny, and as he did this people watched, gathering around him. He's at home staring up at the ceiling, face red from crying all afternoon, and he's lost in his mind. All he could hear ringing in his head was "she didn't deserve this, and it should've been me instead." Then everything went blank, nothing existed in his mind but the image of her laying in those railroad tracks mangled, and crushed. He began to hear a cracking sound as a jar full of red replaced the image of her, and its cracking leaking a black substance. 
<br><br>
        He watched it burst sending the substance flying everywhere, and he then woke up seeing nothing but a red blur covering everything. He walked directly into the kitchen instead of getting ready though it was a school day, and he made breakfast for everyone. Once he was done he began walking back to his room brushing past his early waking father who takes it as an insult, and grabs him by the arm saying "look here you brat!" He didn't flinch as he grabbed him but instead turned slowly to face him looking him in the eyes smiling manichly with tears rolling down his cheeks. He then says to his father "what was that father, i don't think i quite heard you right, did you call me a brat!?" 
<br><br>
        His father stared angrily clearly under the influence of alcohol, and said "yeah i did, and what're you going to do about it BRAT!?" Alex proceeded to rip his arm out of his fathers hand, and punches him in the stomach saying "i think i'll do this about it FATHER!" As soon as his father fell, the sound of chains falling apart rang in his head as all he could think was "why, how, nothing’s left, and most importantly REVENGE." He then finished walking to his room, and got ready for school quickly. After that he walked out, and started walking to school while sobbing realizing Jenny will never walk with him again.
<br><br>
       He screams in pain, smiling manichly the rest of the way, scaring off everyone around him. He arrived at the school, eyes bloodshot, and people avoiding him as he passed through. He went through the day being avoided as the teachers constantly asked him to stop scaring the other students. Once lunch came around again he followed the group of bullies, and he waited till they split up. He followed the one who went by themself, following them into the bathroom before jumping them. 
<br><br>
       He put them in a headlock before they started struggling, and broke free resulting in him slamming their head into the sink saying "how do you like this buster!" In the mirror the bully saw him smiling.  He continued "what cat got your tongue, I SAID HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS!" as he slammed his face onto the counter again.. He watched as fear filled their eyes, and smiled even wider watching them cry. As he did so he saw flashes of the group of bullies pushing him around, and the one he was beating on slamming Alex into the sink just as he was doing to the bully now.
<br><br>
       He grabbed him by the back of the head while having flashbacks of them dunking his head in the toilet until he turned blue in the face in the same stall he went into before doing exactly that to them. He did it three times before he heard the bell ring for the end of school, and dragged the unconscious bully out of the school unnoticed. He dragged him all the way to his house, and tied them up to a chair in the basement before kicking them in the stomach saying “enjoy your stay… Just kidding, I hope you rot in your own dispar!” While laughing maniacally. He punches them in the face, knocking them out before leaving, and goes to wash up in the bathroom covered in blood. After he’s done cleaning up he looks in the mirror, and doesn’t recognize himself with the bloodshot eyes.
<br><br>
        The next day he walked into school late, and one of the bully’s said “oooh look teach he’s la..” as Alex decked them. He continued to his seat, and nobody else said anything about his actions. The day continues, and he watches the group of bullies' concern about their absent member continue to increase. After a while he had to go to p.e, and so did one of the bullies too. The coach had some students bring out the balls for some dodgeball, and Alex snickers watching the bully smile, staring at the more vulnerable students like a snack.
<br><br>
     The coach blew his whistle, and started the game. Alex ran to the middle of the gym, grabbed a ball, and backed away watching as the bully on the other team began to hit even his own teammates with the balls as hard as possible. Alex snickers, smiling maniacally before taking the ball he grabbed, and slamming it into the bully’s abdomen making them fall on their knees. Alex watches as he gets up, never going to the sideline, and Alex does it again with a harder ball making him fall again spitting up blood before his teammates trample over him. Alex begins having flashbacks of how the bully did the same thing to him when he was forced to be on their team, and it makes something inside him snap again before he goes all out. 
<br><br>
       Alex gets his teammates to throw him some balls as he throws them at the enemy side, getting out all of the other team except the bully. He watched laughing hysterically as the bully threw the balls back at Alex’s team weakly, quickly running out of balls, and looked in fear as he saw the other side's whole team start to circle him. In Alex’s team, each person is holding two balls, and launches them as hard as possible at the bully with as much force as they all could. The game ends, and the coach calls both Alex, and the bully to clean up the supplies, making Alex smirks as he cleans up. He follows the bully into the gym closet, and closes the doors behind him making the bully squeal like a little girl.
<br><br>
       He walks over to the bully, and whispers in his ear excitedly “well now barker, how the tables seem to have turned?” Alex starts seeing more flashbacks of after school in the same closet being surrounded by the group of bullies, and was beaten with the baseball equipment. He snickers while watching the same person who beat him to a bloody mess whimpering in fear, reeking of pee sobbing, and begging for mercy. Alex laughed saying “wow, so all I had to do was take away the wolf's pack to make you beg for mercy!?” He walks over to the baseball equipment bin, and grabs a bat chuckling while saying “ooh look at me I’m the big bad wolf, and now I’m going to make you feel despair!”
<br><br>
      He walks over to the bully, and raises the bat before swinging at their face missing on purpose as the bully wets themself again. He laughs at them yelling “what’s wrong, don’t like being on the other end of the bat this time!!?” Before shoving the end of the bat into the bully’s stomach. The bully heaved as Alex repeatedly slammed the end of the bat into their stomach, and he laughed maniacally. After a few more hits he says “y‘know what, this is boring me.” as he swings the bat hitting them in the kneecaps, and they fall to the ground screaming in pain. He stops, and rips off the bully’s shirt, and stuffs it in their mouth before continuing, muffling their screams.
<br><br>
      He laughs at the bully as their screams for help are muffled, and swings the bat hitting them in the forehead knocking them out. Alex sighs in disappointment, saying to the unconscious bully “wow, I thought you were all big, and bad but you're just a puny bug!” Alex grabs a nearby jump-rope, and uses it to tie up the bully before leaving for his next class. The day finishes going by, and soon enough the bell rings dismissing school. Once he heard the bell he would quickly go to the gym, and go into the closet retrieving the bully who’s still unconscious.
<br><br>
      He leaves the school through the gym, and once again goes directly to the basement at home. He untied the bully, and tied him to another chair as they woke up. He heard them start to try to escape which makes him sock him in the nose knocking him back out, and finishes tying them down before leaving. The next day he gets dressed before leaving the house, and goes to the graveyard. He visits Jenny’s grave, and remembers the day they both went to her mothers funeral.
<br><br>
       That exact day was a rainy day with a thunderstorm, and they both dressed in all black watching them lower her mothers casket. She was crying on his shoulder as he hugged her, tears welling up in his eyes as he felt nothing but sorrow, and respect for her mother. After they finished the burial both him, and Jenny went to a nearby park. They went to the swings, and started swinging as she started to say “I feel so… empty now you know?” He responded to her saying “yeah I feel you, it’s not easy to accept, but one day you’ll be able to.” 
<br><br>
        She responded to him sobbing “b-but she’s gone now, I’ll n-n-never see her again!” He tells her “I know, but just think of it this way, she’ll be somewhere better watching over you.” They then swing together until she says “I wish it was me instead.” Her mother had died in a hit, and run done by a local group of thugs. I say to her in response “I’m glad it wasn’t though, because that gives you a chance to make her proud, and I still get to have you.”
<br><br>
      She smiles at him happily with tears in her eyes saying “thank you Alex.” As she cried. He comes back to reality in front of Jenny, and her mothers grave sobbing asking aloud “why god, why did you have to take her, was one not enough for you!?” He cries, tears soaking the gravestone as he places roses on her grave, and walks away before he gets seen. After that when he gets home he grabs one of the half empty bottles of liquor left by his drunkard parents, and pours some in a glass. He takes the glass, and debates drinking it before pouring it down the sink along with what’s in the bottle. 
<br><br>
         He wakes up the next morning, wanting to go back to bed before getting ready for school. He goes to school, and on his way in he sees another one of his bullies messing with a girl. He watches as he gets progressively more “touchy feely” before deciding to go deal with him. He walks up to them as they start trying to assault the girl, and he slams his fist in their face saying “leave the girl alone, or there’ll be more than just that!” After that the bully stares at him before going to push him down. Alex dodges, and watches as the bully falls flat on his face before laughing hysterically.
<br><br>
        The bully gets up leaving a red puddle on the ground, and turns around presenting his bloodied nose. He rushes at Alex again, but this time Alex doesn’t dodge, and gets hit. Once he was hit he looked over at the principal who was right behind the bully, smiling like he just won the lottery. The principal taps the bully’s shoulder, and whispers in his ear “what do you think it will cost to get out of a two year sentence in prison?” The bully looks back, seeing the principal, and tries to run away getting tripped by Alex slamming his face against the concrete again.
<br><br>
       The principal helped Alex up, and asked him what happened. Alex explained to the principal “well, I just arrived at the school when I saw him trying to cop a feel on that young lady right over there, and she asked him to stop which he didn’t.” Alex continued “so I walked up, and said “she asked you to stop, so stop” which led to him coming at me.” Alex finished with “after that he missed falling on his face, he got up coming at me again, and the rest you saw.” The principal then says “well boy you did a good thing standing up for her, and as for you boy your parents will hear of this!”
<br><br>
       After the principal left with the bully the girl walked up to me saying “th-thank you um… What's your name?” He told her with his hand behind his head “it’s Alex, and your welcome it was nothing honestly.” She said to him “oh yeah my names misty, and thanks again.” After that they both went inside, and went there different ways. Later at lunch he spots the same girl from that morning sitting alone in the corner of the lunch room, and decides to go sit with her. 
<br><br>
      He sits on the other side of the table, and says “hey, you're misty right?” She looks up from her book in shock, and says “y-yeah that’s me, who’s asking?” He says happily in response, “It’s Alex from this morning.” She then responded “oh yeah, thanks again for earlier!” He replied “yeah you're welcome, so how are you doing?” 
<br><br>
      She says she’s fine, and then they begin to chat a little. Alex asked her “hey so, what book is that?” She responds “oh it uh…” as she looks at the cover before continuing “it’s that one famous novel, Hairy pottery.” He replies to her in curiosity “so misty, what's it about?” She says “oh umm… it’s about a orphan who lives with his uncle, and he becomes a amazing pottery craftsman at hogsnorts.” 
<br><br>
      After that they conversed about it until it was time to go back to class. They both leave, and go to the same class. They look at each other in confusion before laughing, and exchanging phone numbers saying to each other at the same time “let’s be friends!” They both laugh again before sitting down, and finishing off the day. After school he said he’d call her when he got home If she wanted to chat, and then they went their separate ways. 
<br><br>
      Alex walked out of the school to find the last one in the group of bully’s waiting for him at the door. They walked up behind him, and threw a punch at his head which he dodged, and then reciprocated by knocking the bully into the wall. He left the bully there starting to walk home as they came back, and punched him in the back. He arched his back as he took the punch taking no damage, and turned around punching the bully in the stomach multiple times before they fell over. Alex then kicked them in the head as hard as possible, knocking them out, and then dragged them to his basement.
<br><br>
      He ties them up to a pipe in the basement, and kicks them in the gut waking them up. He looks down at them, and says “hope you're ready for later tonight buddy cause you’ll get to feel what you put her through you…!” He stopped as he heard his phone ring, and kicked the bully in the head knocking them out before leaving to take the call. He answers the call to hear misty saying “hey Alex”, and he responds “hey misty, what’s up?”
<br><br>
      They go on talking till midnight, and hang up saying goodnight. After that he drags the bully’s one by one to the train tracks with their mouths covered with duct tape. He tied them down to the rail about a mile apart from each other right before they heard a train horn coming their way. He backs up from the tracks after removing their tape, and listens as they scream for mercy, begging for help before getting run over by the train. After that he left, and went back home.
<br><br>
    The next day he saw on the daily news that three unrecognizable teens were tied to a railroad track, and ran over by the train. He laughed to himself feeling proud of what he did, and misty called him immediately after the news went off. He felt scared as he answered the phone, and heard exactly what he feared. Misty said over the phone “hey Alex you saw the news right?” He responded to her question “yeah I did, why do you ask?” 
<br><br>
       She answered him, making him feel extremely afraid. “Well I saw that, and I had to ask, was that you, did you do that?” He said to her “let’s talk this out in person, please.” She responds “sure, but you have to tell me, so where are you?” He then says the burger joint across from the school, and then they end the call.
<br><br>
      He watches as she walks into the restaurant, and says “hey, look I can exp…” before she says “don’t, there’s no reason to do something like that.” He says to her beginning to sob “just listen please, they had it coming ok, you don’t know what they did to her…” she looks at him confused, and asks him “who are you talking about, her?” He says to her now crying “m-my cousin, she was in the same grade as me, a-and th-they killed her!” She looks at him, her eyes wide, and responds “I didn’t know that they… but why?” 
<br><br>
         He responds “Because they’ve bullied me since I started school,  I guess she told on them making them mad, and they tie her to the railroad to get back at her, I know it was them cause I heard them say it.” She looked at him for a while before deciding to get up, and walk over to his side of the table. She spoke softly in his ear saying “I’m sorry about what they did, but hey I’m here for you.” Once she finishes she hugs him, and says “hey let’s go somewhere else.” He says “sure?” as they both leave, and go to the nearby park.
<br><br>
         Three months passed since then, and the both of them have gotten closer. During those three months he didn’t run into any bullies. We now see both of them at Jenny’s grave, tending to the flowers at her grave, and him speaking to Jenny.

<center><h1>Lost Boy of the Dreams a I Dreamt</h1></center>
  <br><br>
  One day a boy would be found on the streets abandoned by all around him, and himself. This boy's name would be Daryl, and he would be alone in the dark cold alley ways of the bright, loud, bustling streets of the city. He was from a poor family who was always dealing with debt, and with both an abusive father, and a deathly ill mother who had died leaving the father to abandon the boy. The boy would often find himself being kicked, and beat on by the local boys, and sometimes even the adults. He would often dig through garbage bins, and trash cans searching for leftover food from the rich people's houses. 
<br><br>
         He would often weep in a box, depressed, and alone hoping that one day he would find someone who would take him in. He had always dreamed of one day finding someone who would love him like their own, and care for him unlike his father. One day he was woken up to find a man dressed in a black suit, and red tie asking him if he was ok. Daryl unknowingly said “why, would you care!?” As the man then said politely “because, it’s common manners, especially when one seems hurt, or like they’ve fallen.” 
<br><br>
         Daryl then got up, and he tried to run away as the man said “I wouldn’t go that way young man!” as he ran his attention was on the man behind him, and he ran right into a big man who seemed to be from a local gang. The man had walked over as the big man grabbed Daryl by the collar on what’s left of his shirt saying “why you stupid brat, how dare you dirty my new shirt!” The man looked at the thug, and then in a heartbeat the thug dropped the boy, and ran off saying to the other thugs “run, it’s them!” The man then says “well boy, will you take my hand” as he lent his hand to help Daryl stand up. Daryl takes his offer, and mumbles under his breath “thank you.” 
<br><br>
    The man quickly said “your welcome!”, and he then continues “what’s your name boy?” Daryl responds “my name's Daryl, sir.”  The man then say’s “well, Daryl, my name is Lucifer, though you can call me Lucy.” The man then continues “Daryl, how would you like it if I… took you under my wing, hmm?” *”took you under my wing” meaning to take them in as an apprentice, or student*
<br><br>
     Daryl then said to Lucy “sure, I guess?” Lucy responded to Daryl “well now, come with me boy, let’s ride back to my office so we can discuss the rest of this matter.” Both of them then get into a nice, shiny black Cadillac, and head directly to Lucy’s office. Once they arrived, Daryl looked up out of a window in shock. Daryl may not have known who Lucy was, but he did know now that Lucy was none other than the one known as the richest, most powerful mafia boss of the underworld. *the term “underworld” is used as code name for the secrete doings of mafias*
<br><br>
	Lucy then looks over at Daryl and says “Come on boy, there’s plenty more to gaze at inside the building.” Daryl, who was now accepting the current situation, got out of the Cadillac, and followed Lucy inside. As they went to walk into the building Lucy stopped Daryl, and said “leave your shoes out here boy.” he took off his shoes leaving them by the door, and followed behind lucy. They then walk through the building going directly to Lucy’s office.
<br><br>
          Daryl walks into Lucy’s office, and sits down as Lucy walks in.  Lucy takes off his coat, and Daryl looks up surprised. Daryl looked in shock, as he saw That he was wrong about Lucy.  Lucifer was a woman, and a stunning one at that. He became very intrigued, wondering how she sounded, and looked so masculine. 
<br><br>
      Once she sat down she spoke, and it made shivers run down his spine. To him she sounded like an angel with her soft voice, and undeniably soft spoken tone. She said to Daryl “what’s wrong boy, you look like you’ve seen a ghost?” He spoke with a stutter, “n-nothing, m-m-m-ma,am.” Lucy then began “well then if that’s so, let us get to it boy~”.
<br><br>
      She slides a freshly printed paper with the sent of perfume across the desk, and says sternly “ read, and sign this for me, okay boy.” I picked it up, and read it from top to bottom. it stated: 
<br><br>
        (Once you sign this paper you will have accepted a contract with Lucifer to bind your soul to her, and give all rights to your well-being to Lucifer as your new parent/guardian. Under this contract you will become the child, and property of Lucifer. If by any means you break the contract without the other's consent you will suffer the other’s decided punishment for however long they wish.). 
<br><br>
       I read it, and I looked at her confused. “why was she having me sign a contract to become her child, why would my soul be bound to her?” I asked myself skeptically. She looks at me, and says enthusiastically  “well boy it’s simple, it’s to ensure you don’t try to run off with another gang.” I then in shock responded “o-okay.” Before signing the contract.  She then gets up, and walks over to me saying “this will hurt a little.” As she uses a needle to poke my thumb before pressing it down on the paper next to my signature. 
  <br><br>
             As she lifted my thumb off the paper the blood moved, and made a pentagram. Once it soaked into the paper it burned up, and disappeared. She then said “well boy, welcome to your new family.” As she giggles. She begins to explain in a soft tone “now that you’ve signed the contract, you will be my son, and in return for me taking care of you all I ask of you is to do as I say.”.

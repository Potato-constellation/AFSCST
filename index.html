Welcome to the official After School Studios website. Yes we are aware there is an UNOFFICIAL website which posts our stories.
Sadly this website isn't even coded in HTML or CSS like this one therefore I can personally insure that this website is far better
in terms of quality. If anyone on the site has an idea you think would make a story please email Potatolord2009@gmail.com. We will 
also write essays for anyone who will pay.
